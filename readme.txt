Link directly to a specific WooCommerce product variation using get variables (yoursite.com/your-single-product?size=small&color=blue).

== Description ==

Link directly to a specific WooCommerce product variation using get variables - yoursite.com/your-single-product/?size=small&color=blue. This is useful if you want to send an email to customers and send them directly to a specific variation without them having to enter it in themselves.

Usage/Examples:

Attach: ‘?[variation_name]=[variation_value]‘ to the end of your product link to have the variations automatically appear on the user’s screen.

* mysite.com/product/happy-ninja/?color=blue
* mysite.com/product/happy-ninja/?color=blue&size=small (additional variations should be separated by '&')
* mysite.com/product/happy-ninja/?color=blue+green (where the variation value is "Blue Green" with the space replaced by a '+')
* mysite.com/product/happy-ninja/?color-type=transparent (where the variation key is "Color Type" with the space replaced by a '-') 

Features:

* No configuration needed, just install and start using
* Supports an infinite number of variations
* Fails gracefully, if the option or value doesn't exist, the default value will appear instead
* Default selected variations work if no product is specified in url
* 100% case insensitive
* Works with any variation settings you have ie. custom images, prices etc.
